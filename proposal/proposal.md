## Overview
Skyline is a full-stack react app designed for a small recording-studio business. 
The functionality of this app can be easily refocused for other businesses.

We will utuilize a database for reviews and/or calender updates. 

The login function will allow clients to request studio times depending on availability and also post reviews of the studio.

There will be an admin login route that will load a page with further utility, such as a delete and confirmation button for appointments and reviews, and the ability to reply to reviews.

This app will display the space, the employees, the technology and equipment, and examples of work created by other artists. Skyline will give users a good idea of what is available to them as customers.

Along with this, users will be able to view a schedule of availability and contact the studio directly. 

## The Problem and Solution
Being a small business today is hard. Standing out among big businesses and other small businesses requires more than just a superior product. Small businesses need to be seen, and once seen, they have to hold the consumer's attention and simultaniously leave an impression. There are many ways that businesses can achieve this impression. Web presence and professionalism are great starts.
